# Gatekeeper
Cross-Platform Game Using the libGDX library (Java)

Interesting concepts I learned through this project:
  - Using Sprite Sheets (Texture Atlas) to conserve space and decrease loading time, as well as for animations.
  - Working with polygons at the vertex level. Manipulating shapes for hit-detection.
  
This iteration of Gatekeeper was my first try at materializing the idea I had for the game. Since Java is the language I'm most comfortable with, I used this Java-based game library to make a rough draft of the game, testing it only on my computer. After I was happy with the direction the game was taking, and I was sure how I wanted the final version to look, I began developing it in Unity. It was from Unity that I deployed the app to the app store, check it out here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gatekeeper-space-game/id1146670067?ls=1&mt=8

The final version, and my first draft shown here, have many similarities, but the execution was quite different. This was in part because Unity uses C# scripts, and in part because I believe I wrote better code for the final version. In particular, the algorithms for moving the pipes and the ships were different, and in my opinion better, for the final version.
