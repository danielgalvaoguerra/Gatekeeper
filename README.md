# Gatekeeper
Cross-Platform Game Using the libGDX library (Java)

Interesting concepts I learned through this project:
Using Sprite Sheets (Texture Atlas) to conserve space and decrease loading time, as well as for animations.
Working with polygons at the vertex level. Manipulating shapes for hit-detection.
